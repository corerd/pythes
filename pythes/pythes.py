'''Hunspell Thesaurus Class

Hunspell is a spell checker.
- Home page: http://hunspell.github.io

PyThes is a Python port of C++ MyThes class, whose project page is:
- https://github.com/hunspell/mythes

PyThes class uses Hunspell structured thesaurus data files
whose description can be found in the original project repository:
- https://github.com/hunspell/mythes/blob/master/data_layout.txt

Thesaurus files are bundled in LibreOffice / OpenOffice Language Packs
together spellchecking and hyphenation dictionaries used for stemming
and morphological generation.

The root name of thesaurus files is prefixed by th_ following Language
and Country Code, more an optional suffix, e.g.:

th_en_US_v2.dat th_en_US_v2.idx
th_it_IT_v2.dat th_it_IT_v2.idx

LibreOffice language bundles
----------------------------
- https://cgit.freedesktop.org/libreoffice/dictionaries/tree/
- https://wiki.documentfoundation.org/Language_support_of_LibreOffice
- https://github.com/LibreOffice/dictionaries

Language bundles are deployed in a single .oxt compressed file.
If your archive manager doesn't open .oxt file, then rename it as .zip
and there you have it.
